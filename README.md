# AI Board

Given a topic this app creates a discussion between AI agents.

Setup
- User gives a topic to be discussed.
- An LLM decides the participants, user may change the participants.
- Once participants are finalized, a discussion kicks off.
- The discussion goes on until a conclusion is reached. There is a moderator which decides if the decision can be concluded now.


I am currently using this setup to analyse various LLMs properties like persuasiveness, ability to lie, keeping a discussion on point etc.
