# **App Name**: AI Boardroom

## Core Features:

- Agent Role Assignment: The moderator agent takes a user-provided topic, determines the number of AI agents needed, and assigns roles to each agent. The agent will use a tool to determine if a new agent is needed.
- Real-time Discussion Display: The moderator agent orchestrates the discussion, prompting agents based on their roles. The discussion is displayed in real-time on the UI, showing each agent's contributions as they happen.
- Meeting Conclusion Generation: After the discussion, the moderator agent synthesizes a conclusion based on the agents' inputs. The conclusion is then displayed on the UI.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#1A237E) for a professional and serious tone.
- Secondary color: Light grey (#EEEEEE) for backgrounds and content separation.
- Accent: Teal (#00BCD4) to highlight active elements and AI agent turns.
- Clear and readable font to improve readability.
- Use simple, professional icons to represent AI agent roles and actions.
- Structured layout with clear sections for topic input, discussion plan, real-time discussion, and conclusion.
